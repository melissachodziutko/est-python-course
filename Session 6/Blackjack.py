'''instructions: randomly generate three values between 1 and 11 in main, then send them to your function bust. 
in the function bust: add these three numbers together. 
if they add up to or less than 21, return the sum. 
If it's over 21, return 0. 
If it's over 21 BUT there's an 11 as one of the values, return the sum - 10. '''
